# Instagram App - MVVM Architecture Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the migration of the Instagram app from a simple ObservableObject pattern to a proper MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

## Migration Summary

### Before (Old Architecture)
- Single `SampleData` class handling all data and business logic
- Views directly accessing `SampleData` via `@EnvironmentObject`
- Mixed concerns in views (UI + business logic)
- Difficult to test individual components

### After (MVVM Architecture)
- **Models**: Pure data structures (`Post`, `Comment`, `Story`)
- **Views**: Pure UI presentation components
- **ViewModels**: Handle business logic and state management
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance

## New File Structure

```
Instagram/
├── Models/
│   ├── Post.swift          # Post data model
│   ├── Comment.swift       # Comment data model
│   └── Story.swift         # Story data model (newly created)
├── ViewModels/
│   ├── FeedViewModel.swift      # Handles feed business logic
│   └── PostDetailViewModel.swift # Handles post detail interactions
├── Views/
│   ├── FeedView.swift           # Updated to use FeedViewModel
│   ├── PostRowView.swift        # Updated to use FeedViewModel
│   ├── PostDetailView.swift     # Updated to use PostDetailViewModel
│   └── StoryView.swift          # Updated (Story model moved)
├── SampleData.swift             # Deprecated (kept for reference)
└── InstagramApp.swift           # Updated (removed SampleData dependency)
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created ViewModels

#### FeedViewModel.swift
- **Purpose**: Handles feed data and business logic
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Loading posts and stories
  - Managing loading states
  - Handling like toggling
  - Adding comments
  - Refreshing feed data

#### PostDetailViewModel.swift
- **Purpose**: Handles post detail interactions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Managing comment posting
  - Handling like toggling
  - Managing comment input state
  - Validation logic

### 2. Updated Views

#### FeedView.swift
```swift
// OLD CODE
@EnvironmentObject var sampleData: SampleData

// NEW CODE
@StateObject private var viewModel = FeedViewModel()
```

#### PostRowView.swift
```swift
// OLD CODE
@EnvironmentObject var sampleData: SampleData

// NEW CODE
let viewModel: FeedViewModel
```

#### PostDetailView.swift
```swift
// OLD CODE
@EnvironmentObject var sampleData: SampleData
@State private var newComment = ""

// NEW CODE
@StateObject private var viewModel: PostDetailViewModel
```

### 3. Model Organization
- Created separate `Story.swift` model file
- Kept existing `Post.swift` and `Comment.swift` models
- All models are pure data structures with no business logic

### 4. App Entry Point
- Removed `SampleData` dependency from `InstagramApp.swift`
- Each view now manages its own ViewModel instance

## Benefits of MVVM Architecture

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Views**: Only handle UI presentation
- **ViewModels**: Handle business logic and state
- **Models**: Pure data structures

### 2. Testability
- ViewModels can be tested independently
- Business logic is isolated from UI
- Easier to write unit tests

### 3. Maintainability
- Clear code organization
- Easier to understand and modify
- Reduced coupling between components

### 4. Reusability
- ViewModels can be reused across different views
- Business logic is centralized

### 5. State Management
- Better state management with `@Published` properties
- Reactive UI updates
- Loading states and error handling

## Code Comments and Documentation

All files have been updated with comprehensive comments explaining:
- MVVM architecture changes
- Purpose of each component
- Migration notes
- Old code preserved as comments for reference

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test the app to ensure all functionality works correctly
2. Remove `SampleData.swift` file after confirming everything works
3. Add unit tests for ViewModels

### Future Enhancements
1. Add more ViewModels for other features:
   - `UserProfileViewModel`
   - `SearchViewModel`
   - `SettingsViewModel`
2. Implement Repository pattern for data access
3. Add error handling and loading states
4. Implement proper data persistence
5. Add network layer for real API integration

## Testing the Migration

To test that the MVVM migration works correctly:

1. **Feed Functionality**:
   - Posts should load and display correctly
   - Like buttons should work
   - Stories should display

2. **Post Detail Functionality**:
   - Post details should display correctly
   - Comment posting should work
   - Like toggling should work

3. **Navigation**:
   - Navigation between views should work
   - No crashes or errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the old code is preserved as comments in:
- `SampleData.swift` (complete old implementation)
- Individual view files (old code patterns)

To rollback:
1. Restore `SampleData.swift` to active code
2. Update views to use `@EnvironmentObject var sampleData: SampleData`
3. Update `InstagramApp.swift` to provide `SampleData` as environment object

## Conclusion

The MVVM migration provides a solid foundation for future development with better code organization, testability, and maintainability. The app now follows iOS development best practices and is ready for scaling with additional features.
